# No-dependency svelte tools

⚠️⚠️⚠️ **Still in development** ⚠️⚠️⚠️

⚠️⚠️⚠️ **Not ready for production yet** ⚠️⚠️⚠️

## Why?

I am not a fan of some design patterns in svelte, so I buckled up
and created a set of utility tools for svelte users.

Everything is up-to-date with the newest svelte 5 runes.

No support for svelte 4.
